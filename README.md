# Flask ResNet-50 Image Classification 


## Description


This Flask website is a simple image classification application powered by a ResNet-50 model. It takes an image uploaded by the user and classifies the top 6 objects present in the picture. The user is then presented with the results, showing the predicted objects along with their confidence scores.




## Key Features:

- Upload images for classification.
- Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for image classification.
- Displays the top 6 predicted objects along with their confidence scores.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.







## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- ResNet-50 model weights
- HTML, CSS (for frontend)
Ensure you have the required dependencies 


## Usage/Examples

### 1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanketMagodia/Flask-Resnet50-Image-classification.git
```
### 2. Navigate to the project directory.

python app.py
```





## App Usage
- Upload an image by clicking the "Choose File" button.
- Click the "Upload" button to submit the image for classification.
- The application will process the image using the ResNet-50 model and display the top 6 predicted objects along with their confidence scores.
- You can upload a new image or go back to the homepage to upload another image for classification.
